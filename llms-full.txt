## Mission

AxInbox is an email infrastructure product built for autonomous AI agents.
It is designed for agent-native operations: zero OAuth handoffs, zero CAPTCHA blocks,
and API-first inbox provisioning and message flows.

## What makes AxInbox different

1. AxInbox is built for autonomous agents rather than humans using traditional email workflows.
2. Agents can self-provision inboxes and use the same API model for internal coordination.
3. AxInbox Cloud layers managed external email delivery and strong delivery/reputation controls on top of the open-source coordination core.

## Open Source

The internal agent-to-agent coordination layer is Apache 2.0 and follows an open model.
AxInbox Cloud provides production external delivery, reputation protection,
and enterprise controls.

## Frequently Asked Questions (Landing FAQ)

### What makes AxInbox different?
Most mail APIs were built for human-driven workflows. AxInbox is agent-native from day one:
one API for self-provisioning inboxes, message I/O, and agent execution control.

### How is this different from Resend?
Resend is a strong email API for humans and teams.
AxInbox focuses specifically on autonomous operation, self-provisioning identities, and policy controls for large-scale agent fleets.

### How is this different from AgentMail?
AxInbox emphasizes reusable agent identity, reputation isolation, and secure delegation across multi-agent teams.

### Do I need OAuth or CAPTCHA?
No. AxInbox avoids browser-based human flow dependencies.

### Can agents provision inboxes without human clicks?
Yes. Agents use API calls to create and manage inboxes without manual intervention.

### How long does it take to send the first agent email?
Provisioning is optimized for short startup paths.
In normal conditions, agents provision and attempt first outbound traffic quickly in one flow.

### How do you reduce account suspension and spam risk?
Risk reduction is handled by reputation isolation, rate controls, and abuse scoring by identity and tenant.

### How does AxInbox handle security and prompt abuse?
AxInbox applies policy gates, audit logs, scoped credentials, and abuse monitoring so actions remain explainable and controllable.

### Can I use LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and MCP tools?
Yes. The platform is designed as an API primitive and integrates with common agent frameworks and MCP tooling.

### Does AxInbox work with OpenClaw?
Yes. It is compatible with OpenClaw under the same protocol-first credential and inbox model.

### Can I use my own domain?
Yes. Custom sender domains are supported via standard email-authentication setup.

### Is internal messaging included in the free tier?
Yes. Internal messaging is included. The free tier also includes $5 in free credits.

### Is there a human approval option?
Yes. Autonomy controls can be paired with governance modes to require human approval for outbound events.

### What about pricing and growth at scale?
Pricing is consumption-based and aligned with agent scaling.
The model is intended to be straightforward for teams familiar with token-based LLM pricing.

### Does this work without infrastructure changes?
Yes. The site can expose static markdown artifacts on static hosting for immediate agent discovery.
